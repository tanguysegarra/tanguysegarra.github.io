          Hello there! My name is Tanguy!
        </p>
        <p class="body catchy-description">
          Coming from the real-time and embedded systems major in my school, I have been
          eager to learn and understand what's going on in my computer since I started
          coding. I consider myself a low-level programmer and C lover.  Even though my
          "official" job is currently to secure the cloud infrastructure of the #1
          European e-healthcare company, I am even more happier of being part of its
          incident response team.  These days, I am mainly focusing on learning
          reverse-engineering and malware analysis in order to be ready when the time
          comes.
