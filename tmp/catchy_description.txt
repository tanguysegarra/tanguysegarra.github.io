Hello there! My name is Tanguy!
Coming from the real-time and embedded systems major in my school, I have been
eager to learn and understand what's going on in my computer since I started
coding. I consider myself a low-level programmer and C lover.  Even though my
"official" job is currently to secure the cloud infrastructure of the #1
European e-healthcare company, I am even more happier of being part of its
incident response team.  These days, I am mainly focusing on learning
reverse-engineering and malware analysis in order to be ready when the time
comes.
